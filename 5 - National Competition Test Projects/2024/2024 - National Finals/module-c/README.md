# WorldSkills UK 2024, National Files, Module C: (Back-End Development)

## For Competitors

Distributable files are in [dist](dist). These files are intended to be shared with competitors and include the test project and media files.

## For Educators

Files relevant to the running of the competition are in [src](src). These files are intended for learning purposes as "reverse engineering" approach.

### Example Solution

An example solution is provided. This is **NOT** intended to meet the criteria; it is to give a rough idea of the navigation flow and what features the application can have.

The example was designed to be minimal so that it can be quickly previewed in a browser without running a server.

Most features described in the test project are simulated. For example, localStorage is used for data persistence and basic session management. There is no true authentication or database manipulation.
